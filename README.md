# Library Management Flutter Application

The Library Management Flutter Application is a mobile app designed to help you manage your library collection. This project was created with the help of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. ChatGPT provided assistance with generating the app's features and functionality, as well as answering questions related to software development and programming.
